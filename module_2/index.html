                Pizza has only been known in Russia since the end of the 20th century. At the turn of the millennium,
                the first original Italian pizzerias
                opened in Russia. After that, pizza became a cult phenomenon. In Russia, high-class ingredients are
                often used as a topping. For example, the pizza is topped with caviar, salmon, beef fillets or truffles.
                A well-known Russian variant is the so-called 'Москва' (pronounced 'Moskva') or Moscow Pizza. It is
                topped with tomato sauce, cheese, four types of fish fillet, roe, onions and herbs.

                however that Thai-style pizzas, in homage to Thai cuisine, also appear in the US and elsewhere with
